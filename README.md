# Archived-Projects
## What is this repository about?

These projects are demos and apps I created last year ( [@hu-yan](https://github.com/hu-yan) ) and then listed on my resume. 

## However...

Due to the current company / organization's issue, they are not going to hire me after  graduation. Thus, seeking for new opportunities is now on my agenda.
